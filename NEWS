  instead of serializer. (D Bera)

  speeds up the extension and uses vastly fewer resources.  (Joe)

------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.0
September 15, 2005

Daemon/Infrastructure:
* New and vastly improved Lucene infrastructure. Highlights include:
  + The indexing and querying code has been split.  The entire
    architecture is much cleaner, and we have been able to eliminate
    several horrible hacks that had been introduced for the benefit
    of the file system backend.
  + The index is now semi-transactional; we can make now make some
    guarantees about the index and the beagle-specific filesystem
    metadata not getting dangerously out-of-sync in the event of a
    crash.
  + It is now possible to efficiently modify certain index properties.
  + Hits now are returned in time-order, not score-order.  Scores
    are still available, though will not agree with the old scores
    in some cases.
  + Querying is faster, our query language is better, and the query
    semantics are much more sane.
  + We are much more intelligent about when we optimize the Lucene indexes.
  + Indexables are now abstract indexing requests, and IndexableGenerators
    can thus now manipulate the index in arbitrary ways.
  + Many, many bugs have been fixed.
  (Jon Trowbridge, Joe Shaw, Fredrik Hedberg, Daniel Drake)
* Many bugs involving queries have been fixed, and the query semantics have
  changed.  Querys now default to 'AND', not 'OR'. (Jon, Joe)
* Fixes to avoid stop words ("a", "the", etc.) causing problems during
  queries. (Joe)
* When using a remote home directory, create the unix domain socket
  locally since some filesystems don't support them (like smbfs). (Joe)
* When capping the number of hits returned from the daemon, we now
  return the N most recent hits, not the N highest-scoring hits. (Jon)
* Don't reload config files that haven't changed since we last loaded them.
  (Daniel)
* Reduce inotify watch masks when we can. (Daniel)
* Maintain parent-child relationships when watches are moved. (Daniel)
* Fix a crasher in libbeagle related to using g_stat(). (Joe)
* Update to gtk-sharp 2.x APIs. (Joe, Lluís Pàmies)
* Add an --enable-xml-dump configure option for debugging message
  passing between components. (Joe)
* Many fixes to libbeagle to keep it up-to-date with the C# code. (Joe)

* Use gnome-vfs's slow mime sniffing on files with the .xml extension.
  (Chris Lahey)
* Local index-synchronization when using NFS & Samba. (Fredrik, Joe)
* Support IO priorities by setting the indexing thread to idle. (Fredrik,
  Robert Love)
* Workaround a bug in Mono.Posix.Syscall.readdir to support strange
  encodings. (Fredrik)
* Use transactions more efficiently in our sqlite databases. (Jon)
* Don't poll to check for Inotify.Stop calls while snarfing events. (Jon)
* Don't leak files in /tmp on exceptions or daemon shutdown. (Jon)
* Scheduler improvements and bug fixes.  Tasks are now round-robined
  correctly. (Jon)
* Pass a stemmed, stopword-free version of the query back to the client
  along with the query results, for use by the client app when
  highlighting matches, etc. (Jon)

Backends:
* Migrated all of the backends to the new lucene infrastructure.  (Joe,
  Fredrik, Daniel, Jon)
* The file system backend has been extensively refactored.  It still isn't
  perfect, but has been substantially improved. (Jon, Daniel, Joe, Fredrik) 
* Allow file system exclude patterns/paths to be set through
  beagle-config. (Daniel)
* Misc filesystem backend fixes to do the right thing when we add/remove
  exclude patterns/paths. (Daniel)
* Fix removing of file system roots. (Daniel)
* Merge the concepts of 'scan' and 'crawl' in filesystem backend. (Daniel)
* Rewrite Evolution Data Server backend to support all local
  addressbooks and calendars with change notification, based on Varadhan's
  work in evolution-sharp. (Joe)
* Fix a major bottleneck in starting up the mail backend with IMAP
  accounts that would use large amounts of CPU at startup. (Joe)
* Fix a bug where IMAP accounts against Exchange servers weren't being
  indexed. (Joe)
* Index all IM accounts, not just the first one of each type, in the
  Evolution Data Server backend. (Joe)

  formats. (Daniel)

  Boris Peterbarg)
* Don't leave zombie processes when indexing PDF and spreadsheet
  files. (Daniel)

  dominate the CPU on expensive runs (Paul Betts)

  persistent way. (Joe)

  Especially nice for HTML files. (Joe)

  but evolution-sharp isn't. (Joe)
* Fix a date bug where some results would display as happening "-N days
  ago". (Joe)
* Thumbnail file hits. (Debajyoti, Joe)
* Don't run the crawler as part of cron.daily, because it can happen at
  any point during the day and it's an expensive operation.  Add a crontab
  entry which runs at 4:30 am. (Joe)
* Update the Best keybinding code from Tomboy.  Fixes many bugs related
  to different modifiers (num lock, scroll lock, alt, etc.) and fixes many
  "BadValue" crashers. (Alex Graveley, Joe)

  other problems with the best tray icon. (Rodrigo Moya)
