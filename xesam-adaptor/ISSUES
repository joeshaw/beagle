This is a list of issues we have while implementing the Xesam interface for
Beagle:

* HitsModified: Beagle does not have an equivalent signal, because it'd need
	to maintain a lot of state to track these changes. Instead, we just
	send a HitsSubtracted followed by a HitsAdded.

	This brings us to a whole different problem. GetHits(count) gets
	count hits after a HitsAdded event, sorted in the given order. Now
	what happens if a given set of htis are retrieved, then some are
	modified (or more are added). What does the next GetHits() return? The
	new set of hits, or the first count hits of _all_ hits added so far?

* StateChanged: Beagle does not have a StateChanged signal. Either we poll for
	this periodically (with every new search?), or just let the client
	worry about this.

	In the mean time, xesam-tool will always report [UNKNOWN, 0] for a
	GetState, because it counts on StateChanged alone for figuring out the
	status. Are we suppoed to throw a StateChanged on session (dbus session
	or xesam session?) creation or something?

* Grouping: Beagle doesn't support grouping of ANDs and ORs, it seems. We
	either need to make some drastic changes at lower levels (more R&D
	required), or break up at ORs and start multiple searches for a single
	Xesam search (I don't like this approach -- it is ugly).

* Ontologies: What is the default value for session.vendorOntologies?

* Live searches: What happens if search.live is false? Is it assumed that the
	search is done when SearchStart() terminates? Are signals ignored?
	Beagle doesn't have non-live searches, AFAICT.

* Fields/Sorting: We need the list of fields before we can handle these
