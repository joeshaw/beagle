Beagle Extension: Index webpages you visit using the Beagle Indexing Engine.
An Extension for the Firefox Browser.  

Installing:
	Open the generated beagle.xsi in Firefox or Mozilla.  
	This will fire the Extension Manager.

Notes:
	Executes beagle-index-url located in $PATH, passing the URI and a path
	to a temporary file containing the URI's content.  beagle-index-url 
	should delete this file once it is finished indexing.

TODO:
	- make install rule for installing to global extensions 
	  directory (can be done without running mozilla?)
	- need better icons
	- only index content on initial visit to a page
	- send HTTP headers to beagle-index-url?
	- remove context menu and preferences?
	- improve warnings
	- call beagle-index-url with page title and mime-type
	- watch for beagle-index-url error and clean up tempfile
	- save tempfile in safer place and with better name
	- include install.js for older versions of Firefox (<0.9)
